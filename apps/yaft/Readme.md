Yaft
====

Yaft is forked from https://uobikiemukot.github.io/yaft/.
It's much faster then fingerterm by not using the Qt framework.
All updates are drawn in the Direct Update waveform mode, allowing quick response.

Usage
-----

To use simply execute `yaft` or `yaft <command..>`.

There's an on-screen keyboard that can be partially hidden by long pressing the escape key.
When the type folio is attached the screen will go into landscape mode and the keyboard will be hidden.
Mouse events are supported using the touchscreen.
